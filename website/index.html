						<h2>About The Project</h2>
						<p>Waste pickers in South Africa, and many other countries, are one of the most vulnerable, and overlooked groups. They are exposed daily to increasing risks from handling waste that could be contaminated by a number of viruses. South Africa is estimated to have over 60000 waste pickers who continuously make an indelible contribution towards the countryâ€™s waste management industry. Despite the tireless efforts of waste pickers, the country only recycles about 10% of its waste. Communities should take a firm stance to more sustainable practices and make recycling a personal responsibility. The Trash to Treasure Project therefore aims to create opportunities for communities to access recycling services and to bolster support for waste pickers.

							<p>
								Let's strive to promote sustainable practices and ensure a clean and healthy environment for communities.

							While the primary objective of recycling is often associated with waste reduction, its significance extends far beyond that. One of the most evident advantages of recycling is the reduction of waste and the alleviation of strain on landfills. By diverting materials from landfills, recycling helps extend their lifespan and reduces the need for the creation of new landfill sites. By actively engaging in recycling practices, individuals and communities foster a sense of responsibility towards the environment. So by making daily changes towards a more sustainable life we  are creating a far reaching social impact. As the demand for recycled materials and products increases, so does the need for skilled workers. Therefore by equipping waste pickers with the necessary resources, Trash to Treasure enables people to easily request waste product pickup services, where a team of waste pickers will collect, sort, and dispose of the waste more efficiently.<br>
